# fury-breakout-2020
A remake of Super Breakout (1978 Atari) developed using a teaching language implemented in Racket.

The content of this repository was created by me and three fellow students. We collaborated with SVN for three weeks (November 27th to December 11th) to complete a first-year university project.
